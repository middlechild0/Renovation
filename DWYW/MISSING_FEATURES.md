## 📝 Notes

This document represents the gap between the current MVP state and a production-ready visual website builder. The core architecture is solid, but significant work is needed on the user-facing editing capabilities.

**Priority should be given to:**
1. Image/media management (critical for any website)
2. Content editing (users need to change text/images)
3. Section management (add/remove/reorder)
4. Project persistence (save/load)
5. Actual deployment (generate and deploy real sites)

Once these core features are implemented, the platform will be minimally viable for real users.
